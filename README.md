Any kind of contribution is welcomed and valued ðŸŒˆ

Here is a list of some ideas:

- fiddle with css to make the pages fit nicer on A4 format paper
- allow independent css per page
- abstract the implementation so it can be used for other sites as well
- use more features of PDF
- test it and report bugs
